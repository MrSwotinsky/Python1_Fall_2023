### **PCEP Exam Prep - Data Collections, Part 1**

**AIM:** What strategies can we leverage to correctly answer PCEP questions about data collections?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS63T.4</ins>: Write and analyze programs in relation to **data collections**.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS63T.6</ins>: **Communicate** effectively as a computer scientist.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS63T.8</ins>: Model **employability skills** such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

**Workflow**:
- [ ] I am visibly using code tracing as a strategy to determine the output of given code snippets.
- [ ] I am engaging in collaborative problem solving within my terrific trio or fantastic four to determine the output of given code snippets.
- [ ] When my terrific trio or fantastic four gets stuck, we are leveraging support from other dynamic duos or terrific trios to determine the output of given code snippets.

**Content**:

- [ ] I can determine the output of code snippets that involve...
    - [ ] Nested indices.
    - [ ] Negative indices.
    - [ ] Slices.
    - [ ] Booleans.
    - [ ] the `len()` function.
    - [ ] the `.index()` method.

**DO NOW:**  Load up your virtual environment.  While it is loading up...

Complete the following quick exercises individually...

Given:

```python
my_list = [True, False, 1, 2, 3]
```

Determine the output of each of the following code segments.  If running the code will result in an exception, explain why:

1. `my_list[my_list[1]]`
2. `my_list[-my_list[2]]`
3. `-my_list[my_list[2]]`
4. `my_list[-4:4]`
5. `my_list[4:-4]`
6. `1 in my_list`
7. `len(my_list)`
8. `my_list.index(True)`
   
**AGENDA:**  

* Review Do Now
* PCEP Exam Prep Exercises
    * Workflow:
        * Facilitator
            * Manage workflow.
            * Keeps track of workflow success criteria during practice.
            * Leads self collaborative self assessment of content success criteria after practice.
        * Groups 1, 2, and 3:
            * Complete any **four** problems with `nums` list.
            * Complete any **two** problems with `this_list` list.
        * Groups 4, 5:
            * Complete any **two** problems with `nums` list.
            * Complete any **four** problems with `this_list` list.
        * Discuss & Code Trace > Determine Output > Confirm by Coding
        * If your terrific trio or fantastic four gets stuck, seek out help from a different terrific trio or fantastic four 
* Collaborative self assessment.
* (Pending time) Full class Summary/Share.
  <br> *If there is not enough time for a full class Summary/Share today, we will end today's class with the collaborative group assessment and start tomorrow's class with a full class Summary/Share of today's work.*

**HOMEWORK:** If you have not yet done so, complete your pre-assessment for data collections (PCEP Compendium > Exam Block 3 > Review Material + Quiz)
