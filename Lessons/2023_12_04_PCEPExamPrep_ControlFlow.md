**REFERENCE:**

|Compendium Strategies|Reflection Expectations|
|--|--|
|1. Read through the review material carefully before attempting the quiz<br><br>2. As you read through the review material, take notes.<br><br>3. As you read through the review material, also take some time to engage in conversations with colleagues to confirm your understandings and clarify your misconceptions.<br><br>4. While you take the practice quiz,use code tracing as a strategy to determine the correct answers.<br><br>5. While you take the practice quiz make note of the questions you find challenging to review after you complete the quiz.| 1. Create a markdown file using the following title: <br> `lastNameFirstInitial_Reflection_PCEP_ControlFlow_0.md`.<br><br>2. Work through the quiz review, comparing your answers to the correct answers.<br><br>3. For each question you either answered incorrectly or found challenging submit a reflection that contains the following:  <br><li> The question itself, including any text, code, and answer choices.<br><li>The correct response.<br><li>Your response.<br><li>A breif explanation explaining your error.<br><br>4. Remember to include an appropriate heading and title within your markdown file.|

**Hints:**
* To a write single line of code in markdown, enclose it in backticks:<br> `` `CODE GOES HERE` `` <br>(The backtick is located to the left of the number one on most keyboards)<br><br>
* To write multiple lines of code in markdown, surround it vertically with triple backticks above and below the code.  You can also specific the coding langugage by naming it after the first set of triple backticks.
