### **Tuples**

**AIM:** What are tuples, and how can they be leveraged to develop programs?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS63T.4</ins> Write and analyze programs in relation to **data collections**.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I can articulate what a tuple is as well as what tuples have in common with lists, and how tuples differ from lists.
- [ ] I can generate tuples.
    - [ ] Tuples with one element.
    - [ ] Tuples with more than one element.      
- [ ] I can generate copies of tuples.
- [ ] I can reference elements in a tuple.
- [ ] I can generate slices of a a tuple.
- [ ] I can perform operations with tuples.
    - [ ] `len()`
    - [ ] `+`
    - [ ] `*`
    - [ ] `in` 
    - [ ] `not in`
- [ ] I can explain **why** some specific commands that work with lists will not work with tuples.
    - [ ] `.append`
    - [ ] `del`
    - [ ] `my_tuple[INDEX] = VALUE`

**DO NOW:**  

1. Load up your virtual environment.
2. Create a new practice file for practicing with tuples.
3. Be prepared to code along in two minutes.

**AGENDA:**  

* Sequences (interactive code-along)
* Mutable Sequences (interactive code-along)
* Tuples (interactive code-along)
* Generating Tuples (interactive code-along)
* Tuples vs. Lists (interactive code-along)
* Referencing Elements in Tuples
* Slices of Tuples
* Operations with Tuples
* Commands that will not work with Tuples.

**HOMEWORK:** Looking Back...

**Be sure to use only one launch for the following:**
1. In the PCEP Compendium, carefully review all study material for exam block one - computer programming and python fundamentals. Rember to apply the strategies described in the reference section below.
3. Complete the practice quiz.
4. Complete and upload your reflection to your GitHub portfolio.  Remember to align your reflection to the reflection expectations described in the reference section below.

**REFERENCE:**

|Compendium Strategies|Reflection Expectations|
|--|--|
|1. Read through the review material carefully before attempting the quiz<br><br>2. As you read through the review material, take notes.<br><br>3. As you read through the review material, also take some time to engage in conversations with colleagues to confirm your understandings and clarify your misconceptions.<br><br>4. While you take the practice quiz,use code tracing as a strategy to determine the correct answers.<br><br>5. While you take the practice quiz make note of the questions you find challenging to review after you complete the quiz.| 1. Create a markdown file using the following title: <br> `lastNameFirstInitial_Reflection_PCEP_ControlFlow_0.md`.<br><br>2. Work through the quiz review, comparing your answers to the correct answers.<br><br>3. For each question you either answered incorrectly or found challenging submit a reflection that contains the following:  <br><li> The question itself, including any text, code, and answer choices.<br><li>The correct response.<br><li>Your response.<br><li>A breif explanation explaining your error.<br><br>4. Remember to include an appropriate heading and title within your markdown file.|

**Hints:**
* To a write single line of code in markdown, enclose it in backticks:<br> `` `CODE GOES HERE` `` <br>(The backtick is located to the left of the number one on most keyboards)<br><br>
* To write multiple lines of code in markdown, surround it vertically with triple backticks above and below the code.  You can also specific the coding langugage by naming it after the first set of triple backticks.
````markdown
```python
CODE GOES HERE
```
````
