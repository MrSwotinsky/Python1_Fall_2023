**DO NOW:**  

**Note: Load up your virtual environment.  While it is loading up:**

1. Copy/Paste and run the following block of code in repl.it:

```python
list_a = [1,2,3]
list_b = list_a
print("List A: " + list_a)
print("List B: " + list_b)
print()

list_a = [7,8,9]
print("Updated List A: " + list_a)
print("Updated List B: " + list_b)
print()

this_list = ['first','next']
that_list = this_list
print("This List: " + this_list)
print("That list: " + that_list)
print()

this list = ['first', 'list']
print('Updated This List: ' + this_list)
print('Updated That List: ' + that list)
```

2. Write down what you notice:
* For `list_a` and `list_b`, what happened to `list_b` when you changed `list_a`?
* For `this_list` and `that_list` what happened to `that_list` when you changed `this list`?
* Can you explain what is going on here?
* What does this say about the way list data is stored in memory?
* Can you identify, explain, and correct the error Mr. Swotinsky made when he described how list data is stored in memory?
3. In dynamic duos or terrific trios, share your observations.
4. Be prepared to share your partners' observations with the class.

   
**AGENDA:**  

* Revisiting memory storage for lists.
* PCEP Check In - Compendium block 2 (control flow) practice quiz.
* Incorporating lists into simple programs.
* Summary / Share.
